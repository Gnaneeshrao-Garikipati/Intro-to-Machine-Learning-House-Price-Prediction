# Intro-to-Machine-Learning-House-Price-Prediction
This is the first dataset we are handling after learning the introduction to machine learning. This dataset is from kaggle and competition is still active. The goal of this dataset is to predict the sale price of the house. This dataset contains 2 csv files i.e., train and test. Train consists 1460 rows of house Id's and 80 columns(Features) excluding Id column. Test consists 1459 rows and 79 columns excluding Id column. The features of dataset are combination of both categorical and numerical.The evaluation of the dataset is based on RMSE(root mean squared error). In this repository we had pushed our work on dataset like preprocessing the data, using different algorithms or models etc. We had pushed the changes we had made on the work to boost the rank in kaggle from 3700 to 1054.
