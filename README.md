### INTRODUCTION 
This is the first dataset we are handling after learning the introduction to machine learning. 
   1. This dataset is from kaggle which is a competition and is still active. 
   2. The goal of this dataset is to predict the sale price of the house. 
   3. This dataset has two csv files they are train and test, features of this dataset are combination of both categorical and numerical. 
   4. Train consists, 1460 rows of house Id's and 80 columns(Features) excluding Id column. 
   5. Test consists 1459 rows and 79 columns excluding Id column(Does not contain Sale Price column which have to be predicted). 
   6. The evaluation of the dataset is based on RMSE(root mean squared error). 
   7. In this repository we had pushed our work on dataset like preprocessing the data, using different algorithms or models etc. 
   8. We have pushed the changes we had made on the work to boost the rank in kaggle from 3700 to 1054.
